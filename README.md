# Database-Project
In my Database Management Systems course at CUNY Baruch College, I worked with 3 other students to design, model, and implement a relational database using SQL 
on Microsoft Access. We worked as a team to figure out a business scenario to build the database off of. An E-R diagram in UML notation was made to show the
relationships of the business and to show cardinality. All entities had a unique ID and overall it shows the bookstore business as a whole. Putting the UML notation
into sentences made the conversion to a relational model smooth. Keys and foreign keys were listed for the ID's. We then normalized those relations up to 3NF. We then
implemented the normalized relations into Microsoft Access by writing SQL CREATE TABLE statements. Each column had a data type and a primary key and constraint were 
assigned. We then used ALTER TABLE statements to create the relationships and add the foreign keys. INSERT statements were used to write data for the bookstore.
